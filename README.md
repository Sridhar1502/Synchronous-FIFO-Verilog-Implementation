# Synchronous-FIFO-Verilog-Implementation
Implemented a parameterized synchronous FIFO in SystemVerilog with configurable width and depth. Verified using a self-checking testbench with constrained random stimulus, tasks, and a scoreboard to validate full, empty, overflow, and underflow conditions, ensuring correctness and reusability.
