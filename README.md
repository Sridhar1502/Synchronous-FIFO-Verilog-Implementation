# Synchronous FIFO (SystemVerilog)
- This project implements a parameterized synchronous FIFO with configurable width and depth in SystemVerilog. It is designed for high-performance digital systems requiring reliable data buffering between producer and consumer logic.

# Features
- Configurable data width and FIFO depth
- Support for full and empty flag generation
- Overflow and underflow condition handling
- RTL designed in SystemVerilog, fully synthesizable

# Verification

- Developed a self-checking SystemVerilog testbench
- Used tasks and scoreboard-based verification
- Applied constrained random stimulus for robustness
- Verified edge cases, including full, empty, and read/write simultaneously

# Skills Demonstrated
- Digital Design (FIFO architecture, RTL design)
- SystemVerilog (RTL + Testbench)
- Verification (Scoreboard, Random stimulus, Assertions)
- Simulation & Debugging
